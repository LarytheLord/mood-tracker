# Sentilytics
A Mood Tracker with Sentiment Analysis

## About the Project  

The **Mood Tracker with Sentiment Analysis** is a collaborative project designed to analyze user-provided text input and identify the sentiment behind it—whether Happy, Sad, or Neutral. The app also tracks and visualizes the frequency of each mood in real-time, providing insights into user emotions over time.  

### Inspiration  
The project was inspired by the increasing importance of understanding emotional well-being and the role text sentiment plays in communication. As a team, we wanted to build a simple yet effective tool to track moods and provide emotional insights in real-time.  

### What We Learned  
Through this project, our team gained valuable experience in:  
- Sentiment analysis techniques using Python libraries.  
- Building user-friendly and dynamic web applications with Streamlit.  
- Data visualization using Plotly.  
- Effective teamwork and code collaboration using GitHub.  

### How We Built It  
1. **Technology Stack**:  
   - **Frontend**: Streamlit for interactive UI development.  
   - **Backend**: Python with `TextBlob` for performing sentiment analysis.  
   - **Visualization**: Plotly for creating interactive mood charts.  

2. **Team Workflow**:  
   - Defined goals and features during brainstorming sessions.  
   - Divided tasks based on individual expertise—backend, frontend, and visualization.  
   - Used GitHub for version control and seamless integration of modules.  

3. **Development Process**:  
   - Implemented sentiment analysis using the `TextBlob` library.  
   - Created real-time mood visualization using bar charts.  
   - Styled the application to support a dark mode theme for better aesthetics.
